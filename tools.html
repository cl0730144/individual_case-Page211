		<h3>About the Artist</h3>
		<p class="news">Hi my name is Chris Liddell and I am an artist and designer. Art is a passion of mine that relieves my stress and brings me comfort as it allows me to exercise my passion in a constructive way. It affords me the opportunity of placing down on paper the images and the beauty in which I see in this world. I’ve always enjoyed working with wood just like my grandfather and have just taken my love for art and for the natural beauty of wood and simply placed a bit of beauty on top of something already so pure and so raw and so real. I hope you enjoy my nature inspired expressions of beauty. Contact me for your custom design orders via Telephone <a href="tel:9095873020">(909) 587-3020</a> or via Email <a href="mailto:chrislliddell@yahoo.com">chrislliddell@yahoo.com</a></p>
		<h3>Favorite Styles</h3>
		<p class="news"><b>Realism...</b>in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.</p>

<h2><a href="tools.html">Wood burning tools</a></h2>
    <p>With the progression of time over the centuries, particularly the Medieval, Renaissance and Victorian eras, wood burning became a more and more popular pastime. A wood burning toolkit during these eras consisted of a portable pot or stove. There were a number of holes made in the lid or stove top. These allowed pointed pokers of varying shaped “nibs” to be inserted and heated in the hot coals placed inside. The pokers or rods would tend to cool off quickly while they were being used, therefore several pokers were required in order to keep the momentum of work going. This method of early wood burning was called “pokerwork”. The progression of “pokerwork” from being a hobby or pastime of the wealthy and jobs for local craftsmen – to a commercial endeavor, happened with the invention of the first machine.<p>
