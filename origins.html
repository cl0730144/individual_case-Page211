		<h3>About the Artist</h3>
		<p class="news">Hi my name is Chris Liddell and I am an artist and designer. Art is a passion of mine that relieves my stress and brings me comfort as it allows me to exercise my passion in a constructive way. It affords me the opportunity of placing down on paper the images and the beauty in which I see in this world. I’ve always enjoyed working with wood just like my grandfather and have just taken my love for art and for the natural beauty of wood and simply placed a bit of beauty on top of something already so pure and so raw and so real. I hope you enjoy my nature inspired expressions of beauty. Contact me for your custom design orders via Telephone <a href="tel:9095873020">(909) 587-3020</a> or via Email <a href="mailto:chrislliddell@yahoo.com">chrislliddell@yahoo.com</a></p>
		<h3>Favorite Styles</h3>
		<p class="news"><b>Realism...</b>in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.</p>
		<h3>Recent Project</h3>

<h2><a href="origins.html">Origins of Pyrography</a></h2>
    <p>Early man documented their life in pictures – as has man throughout the ages. Drawing was the first method that man used to tell stories and communicate. And after the important discovery of fire, the early form of “wood burning” was invented. Follow us through the remarkable history and development of this art and the tools over the ages. That this art form has stood the test of time, is a testament to its durability and charm. This ancient art form is very much alive today with beautiful and decorative products being created at home and on a commercial scale worldwide..</p>
