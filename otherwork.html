		<h3>About the Artist</h3>
		<p class="news">Hi my name is Chris Liddell and I am an artist and designer. Art is a passion of mine that relieves my stress and brings me comfort as it allows me to exercise my passion in a constructive way. It affords me the opportunity of placing down on paper the images and the beauty in which I see in this world. I’ve always enjoyed working with wood just like my grandfather and have just taken my love for art and for the natural beauty of wood and simply placed a bit of beauty on top of something already so pure and so raw and so real. I hope you enjoy my nature inspired expressions of beauty. Contact me for your custom design orders via Telephone <a href="tel:9095873020">(909) 587-3020</a> or via Email <a href="mailto:chrislliddell@yahoo.com">chrislliddell@yahoo.com</a></p>
		<h3>Favorite Styles</h3>
		<p class="news"><b>Realism...</b>in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.</p>

   	<h2>Liddell Design</h2>
    <p>Hi my name is Chris Liddell and I am an artist and designer. Art is a passion of mine that relieves my stress and brings me comfort as it allows me to exercise my passion in a constructive way. It affords me the opportunity of placing down on paper the images and the beauty in which I see in this world. I’ve always enjoyed working with wood just like my grandfather and have just taken my love for art and for the natural beauty of wood and simply placed a bit of beauty on top of something already so pure and so raw and so real. I hope you enjoy my nature inspired expressions of beauty.</p>
    <h2>Origins</h2>
    <p>My work is based on the old world art of Pyrography. A style of art that decorates wood using burn marks from a heated object. The Art style has been around as early as the discovery of fire and has been utilized and practiced in a number of different cultures and countries throughout history including the Egyptians, some African tribes, Romania, Hungary, and Flanders as well as Argentina and other areas in South America. It was also used during the Han Dynasty in China where it was known as Fire Needle Embroidery. The Greeks used the term “pur” which means fire and used the term “graphos” meaning writing to describe the craftwork.</p>
    <h2>Types of Art Sytles</h2>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Abstract</b> - usually about shape, line, value, color, and/or texture.</li>
			<li><b>Art Nouveau</b> - illusionistic but primarily flat, that are highly pattern driven, and that usually incorporate fluid, curving lines.</li>
			<li><b>Manga</b> -  Japanese comic book style developed in 19th Century Japan.</li>
			<li><b>Post-Impressionism</b> - drawings based on light (the preoccupation of the impressionists) but with more attention to geometric shapes.</li>
			<li><b>Realism</b> - convincing representations of reality.</li>
			<li><b>Surrealism</b> - dreamlike and sometimes startling works based on pure imagination.</li>
		</ul>
