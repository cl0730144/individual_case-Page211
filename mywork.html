		<h3>About the Artist</h3>
		<p class="news">Hi my name is Chris Liddell and I am an artist and designer. Art is a passion of mine that relieves my stress and brings me comfort as it allows me to exercise my passion in a constructive way. It affords me the opportunity of placing down on paper the images and the beauty in which I see in this world. Iâ€™ve always enjoyed working with wood just like my grandfather and have just taken my love for art and for the natural beauty of wood and simply placed a bit of beauty on top of something already so pure and so raw and so real. I hope you enjoy my nature inspired expressions of beauty. Contact me for your custom design orders via Telephone <a href="tel:9095873020">(909) 587-3020</a> or via Email <a href="mailto:chrislliddell@yahoo.com">chrislliddell@yahoo.com</a></p>
		<h3>Favorite Styles</h3>
		<p class="news"><b>Realism...</b>in the arts is generally the attempt to represent subject matter truthfully, without artificiality and avoiding artistic conventions, or implausible, exotic, and supernatural elements. Realism has been prevalent in the arts at many periods, and can be in large part a matter of technique and training, and the avoidance of stylization.</p>
		<h3>Recent Project</h3>

<h2><a href="mywork.html">My Work</a></h2>
    <p>My work started back in 2006 in Pomona when I tried to get something for my wife but had no money. I decided to get inventive and try something different that could not be purchased in a store but something that was unique and directly for her and also directly made by me. My work began to expand once I was laid off from my IT job and needed to supplement my income for my family. I started selling my designs and built a website hoping my designs would catch on and I took them to the swap meets to have them sold on consignment and worked directly with people on their design elements. Now that I am working again full-time, I do not have as much time to do my artwork but love to use it as a stress reliever and also to help others and to raise money to provide materials for the homeless.</p>
